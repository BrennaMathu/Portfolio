The goal of this project is for me to learn to code different game mechanics than the ones in Parkour Leap.

## Game Concept
The player needs to climb up the mountain to escape the flood. They need to pick up items to get past obstacles.

## Player Controller
The game is in first person. The player moves around by clicking and moving the mouse to rotate the locked camera.

## Inventory System
The game has a grid with slots. The inventory works by adding items as children of those slots. The items are prefabs with a script that makes them draggable. The Item type is specified with Scriptable Objects.

## Placing Items
The game has inactive GameObjects that are set active when the player has the right item in the tool slot.

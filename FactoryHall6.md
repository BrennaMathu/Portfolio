title: Factory Hall 6
description: Point and click escape room game set in an abandoned factory. My first group project.
---


This was my first group project. The goal was for us to learn how to work together, similair to the way we would in the workplace. This meant working in sprints, using a trello board, and using github.
We also made an itch.io page for the project. You can find it here: [itch.io/factory-hall-six](https://lapraniteon.itch.io/factory-hall-six)

## Game Concept
Factory Hall 6 is a point and click escape room game. It has a combination of clue-related puzzles and logical puzzles. The player is a nightguard who has to check on an abandoned factory because the burglar alarm went off. Once inside, the player discovers that the old machines are on and malfunctoning, causing overheating and a lockdown. They have to fix the machines to escape.

# My tasks

## Project Leader
The group assigned me to be project leader, so my main task was to keep an overview of what needed to be done when, what every team member was working on and keeping everyone on the same page. 
- I made an overview of the gameflow and kept it updated. 
- I made an assetlist for 3D, 2D and external assets that's ordened on priority.
- I handled the communication with the teachers and provided the information they needed.
- I prepared the weekly sprint reviews and ensured that we showed all the important parts of what we were working on.

## Level Design
I worked on the level design for this project. The goals were:
- To make it feel like an old factory. It needs to be a big and square space with rooms with a clear purpose.
- To make sure that the factory doesn't get too big, which would make the player lose overview too much.
- To put in enough details and viewbreakers to make it difficult enough to find the hints for the puzzles.

## Greybox
I made the greybox prototype we showed at our first sprint review.

## Implementing Assets & Dialogue.
I implemented the assets by changing out pieces of the greybox. I imported the artists' and external assets into Unity. Another designer wrote most of the dialogue and designed the dialogue UI. I implemented this into the game.
